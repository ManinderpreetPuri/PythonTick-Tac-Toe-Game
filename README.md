# PythonTick-Tac-Toe-Game
I have designed popular tick-tac-toe game in python. The game is designed in two ways: procedural programmng and object-oriented programming. In this project I have used programming concepts: Classes/Objects, conditions(if/elsif/else), user defined functions, In-build functions, Exception handling. 
I have learned other OOPS concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphisim.
